It's still January, so it seems that I've made it just in time to put together a forward-looking post for the year. I just recently attended Code Mash 2025 in Sandusky, Ohio. This was my first development conference and I got to sit in a lot of sessions with some very thoughtful developers. 

I love conferences like this. I enjoyed them when I was in school for music too. It's inspiring to go to a place where people share what they're working on, what they're passionate about and where they think the field is going. 

My brain has been buzzing since I left the conference, so I thought it would be a good idea to create some intention with this feeling. What are the things that I want to learn and get better at over the coming year? 

## 1. ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller)

I'm currently working in this framework! It's a bit new to me, mostly the MVC pattern was too complex for most of the small projects that I would work on at home. I've got some decent familiarity with it right now, but I want to dig into the docs and build something of my own so that I really understand the .NET specifics, and the usage of the pattern!

## 2. Client-Side .NET (Razor, Blazor)

My exposure to Razor is fairly minimal and Blazor even less so. It seems that the new projects at my company are going the Blazor route. It will be handy to have this skill in my back-pocket. Right now, my client apps come out of my fingers in React, so I'm hoping that some of these skills can transfer over.

## 3. AI and Machine Learning

Yes, yes. The big buzzwords. I just recently posted [an article]()

+ AI and Machine Learning
+ Authentication/Authorization systems
+ Different API Patterns: REST, GraphQL, gRPC, Web, Minimal
+ OOP Principles: 'SOLID', 'YAGNI', 'DRY', 'KISS'
+ Design Patterns - Toy apps for each one
+ SignalR
+ Integration Testing
+ AWS Cloud
+ Software Consulting
+ Working Independently as a Software Developer
+ Client-Side .NET
+ Planning Center API
