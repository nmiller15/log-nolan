How often is it that the next big thing in technology is looked down on? 

>*"There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.* - Thomas J Watson, IBM President, 1943

>*"The truth is no online database will replace your daily newspaper, no CD-ROM can take the place of a competent teacher, and no computer network will change the way government works."* - Clifford Stoll, in Newsweek, 1995

>_“I predict the Internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.”_ - Robert Metcalfe, founder of 3Com, 1995

Every week, and sometimes multiple days a week, TLDR sends me a blog post with the title "This is the problem with vibe coding." And, today was just the last straw. If you've read one of these articles, you've read them all. 

Let me give you the walk through:
+ Vibe coding is fast
+ Vibe coding is unreliable
+ Only engineers who don't know what they're doing would even consider it.

Here's what the mid-career programmer doesn't want to hear: "Your ability to type code is getting less valuable by the second." 

When a new trend catches fire like this, one of two things can happen. First, it can fizzle, and the people who were on the front lines will move to the next thing. Second, it takes off faster than you can keep up if you are convinced late. Do you want to be an Amazon or the millionth Etsy shop? Facebook or one of the dozens of offshoot social media apps?

Is vibe coding producing unreliable code, yes probably.

But, in its infancy, was the computer reliable? Were online marketplaces trustworthy? 

The people who are learning the best ways to partner program with LLMs are going to be the ones who we are talking about in the next 10 years. They're the ones who are working out the kinks. They're the ones putting in the time to become the experts. 

Are some people doing it irresponsibly? Sure, but writing off an entire industry because one of your co-workers can't explain garbage collection is just dumb.

If you're one of the haters, reread the quotes above. You just might become one of them.
