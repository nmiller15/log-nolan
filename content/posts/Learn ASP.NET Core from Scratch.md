If you read my [last post](https://nolanmiller.me/posts/what-id-like-to-learn-in-2025), you read all of the things that I'd like to learn this year, starting with ASP.NET Core. I've spent the past week gathering resources from Microsoft's documentation, blogs, forums and internet searches to create myself a 17 module learning plan.

If you're looking to get your feet wet on Microsoft's full stack web framework, then I hope these resources are helpful for you too. 

FYI: This learning path assumes that you have a basic knowledge of C# syntax and a general knowledge of the available libraries. If you don't, Codecademy has a [free course](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-c-sharp)!
