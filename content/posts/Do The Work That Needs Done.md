This article from BrainBun hit a little too close to home. I want to start a business, or sell a product, or something. But, I know that there's something that's holding me back. I think that it might be what the author talks about here.

For me, I will quickly launch myself into a project, or a new technology to learn, and then my focus changes when the work actually gets hard. I tell myself, "Well this actually isn't pushing the needle." But, that's not true always. 

But, I also avoid doing the hard work by doing the opposite too. I'm in the middle of a larger project that I will use as an excuse to put off working on something that would actually start my business.

The constant mantra, is "I need to learn more about X to do that." It is the first thing that I think when I get a piece of business advice, but it would be better to take Noah Kagan's advice "Now, not how."

>I partly blame the algorithmic feeds a la Twitter/X. It’s a lot easier to get your dopamine from reading than it is from building.

Take action. Be naive. Look stupid. Make mistakes.
